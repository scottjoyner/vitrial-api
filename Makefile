# Unit tests. Uses the module form and the same interpreter resolution as
# test-integration, because the `pytest` console script does not put the repository
# root on sys.path -- `tests/test_production_preflight.py` then fails to import
# `scripts.probe_production_preflight` and collection aborts, which reads as a
# broken repository rather than a broken invocation. See test-integration below.
test:

# The suite CI actually runs, against a real database.
#
# Invoked as `python -m pytest`, not the `pytest` console script, because the latter
# does not put the repository root on sys.path and `tests/test_production_preflight.py`
# imports `scripts.probe_production_preflight`. With the console script that file
# fails to import and collection aborts, which reads as a broken repo rather than a
# broken invocation. CI uses the module form for the same reason.
#
# DATABASE_NULL_POOL=true is not optional. The pooled engine retains connections
# across tests while pytest-asyncio gives each test a fresh event loop, and the
# result is "attached to a different loop" across ~20 tests. CI sets it for the same
# reason; without it this target fails in ways that look like application defects.
