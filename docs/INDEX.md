| `trackers/vitrial-api-TRACKER.md` | Reconciled #28 checkbox state + defect table + verified defects |
| `docs/research/` | Findings that informed decisions or are not yet defects |
| `sessions/` | One note per working session; successes *and* dead ends |
| `memory-seeds/` | Cross-session continuity seeds harvested by memory_seed_service |
| `deploy/README.md` | Deploy, rollback, acceptance, preflight, GC runbook, evidence list |
| `docs/DEVICE_PAIRING_AND_SESSION_SECURITY.md` | Pairing operator flow + session security + resource bounds |
| `docs/REAL-WORLD-QUOTE-DOMAIN-MAPPING.md` | Villa Camila real-quote domain mapping, current-contract fit, and proposed narrow extensions |
